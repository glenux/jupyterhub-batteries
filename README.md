# JupyterHub with batteries

This project aims to provide a variant of [JupyterHub]() docker image with
extra programming languages included.

My goal is to provide an interactive teaching tool that would
be ready-to-use for the following courses:

* Ruby & Rails (with [IRuby from SciRuby]())
* Javascript & NodeJS (with [Jupyter-nodejs]())
* Big Data & R (with ???)
* Linux system administration (with ???)
